# GEEES
**GEEES** is a novelly proposed approach for inferring cell-specific **G**ene-**E**nhanc**E**r Int**E**ractions from Multi-modal **S**ingle Cell Data with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility profiles. GEEES estimates gene-enhancer associations at the single
cell level by considering a cell neighbourhood defined by both the expression of the gene and the accessibility of the enhancer in the gene-enhancer pair.
